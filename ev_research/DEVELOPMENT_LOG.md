# Development Log - EV Research Multi-Agent System

## Project Context and Implementation Details

### Core Features Implemented
1. Multi-Agent Architecture
   - Research Agent: Orchestrates the overall research process
   - Data Agent: Interfaces with NREL API
   - Synthesis Agent: Handles report generation in multiple formats
   - Base Agent: Provides Gemini AI integration with fallback support

2. Gemini AI Integration
   - Primary Model: gemini-pro
   - Fallback Model: gemini-1.5-pro
   - Temperature control for optimal output
   - Automatic fallback mechanism for reliability

3. Report Generation
   - Multiple format support (PDF, DOCX, Markdown)
   - Uses pandoc with XeLaTeX for PDF generation
   - Professional formatting and structure

### Critical Implementation Notes
1. API Integration
   - NREL API for real-time charging station data
   - Gemini AI for analysis and natural language generation
   - Environment variables must be properly configured in .env

2. Dependencies
   - Python 3.12
   - MacTeX for PDF generation
   - All Python packages in requirements.txt
   - XeLaTeX configuration: /usr/local/texlive/2024basic/bin/universal-darwin/xelatex

3. Testing Status
   - Successfully tested with Austin, TX data
   - PDF generation verified with proper LaTeX setup
   - Gemini model fallback mechanism verified

### Important Configuration Details
1. Environment Setup
   ```bash
   conda create -n ev_research python=3.12
   conda activate ev_research
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Required API Keys
   ```
   NREL_API_KEY=your_nrel_api_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

3. MacTeX Installation
   ```bash
   brew install --cask basictex
   sudo tlmgr update --self
   sudo tlmgr install xetex
   sudo tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended
   ```

### Known Working State
- Last successful test: Generated complete report for Austin, TX
- All three output formats (PDF, DOCX, MD) generated successfully
- Gemini API integration functioning with proper temperature settings
- NREL API successfully retrieving and processing station data

### Critical Reminders
1. Always ensure .env file is properly configured
2. XeLaTeX path must be correct in synthesis_agent.py
3. Output directory structure must exist before running
4. Temperature setting of 0.7 proved optimal for report generation

## Recovery Notes
This log was created after a critical error where the original project files were lost. The project has been reconstructed with all core functionality, but some custom configurations and additional files may need to be restored.

### Next Steps
1. Verify environment setup in new IDE session
2. Test report generation with Austin, TX example
3. Confirm all output formats are working
4. Check Gemini API integration and fallback mechanism
