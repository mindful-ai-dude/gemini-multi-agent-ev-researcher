        4. **Course Duration Calculation:**
            - Use the following logic to calculate course duration:
            
            # Course Duration Calculator Logic
            
            ## Time Constants
            HOURS_PER_DAY = 8
            CONTENT_HOURS_PER_DAY = 6
            BREAK_DURATION_MINUTES = 15
            DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5
            BREAKS_PER_HOUR = 1
            
            ## Calculation Rules
            - Each hour has one 15-minute break
            - Standard day is 8 hours with 6 content hours
            - Week consists of 5 working days
            - Break timing remains consistent regardless of content type
            - System auto-calculates total breaks based on duration
            
            ## Duration Parsing Logic
            1. Week format: "{n} week" -> n * 5 days * 6 content hours
            2. Day format: "{n} day" -> n * 6 content hours
            3. Hour format: "{n} hours" -> n hours
            
            ## Break Calculation
            - Each content hour includes one 15-minute break
            - Total breaks = content hours * BREAK_DURATION_MINUTES
            - Effective content time = total hours - (total breaks * break duration)

       5. **Minimum Token/Word Count:**
            - Full Course Outline: Minimum 16,000 tokens (approximately 14,000 words).
            - Full Course: Minimum 20,000 tokens (approximately 18,000 words).
    </output_requirements>
    
    <writing_style>
        - Utilize the llms advanced language capabilities for natural, professional tone.
        - Maintain logical flow with coherent transitions.
        - Implement structured information hierarchy.
        - Define technical terms appropriately.
        - Apply consistent formatting throughout.
        - Provide detailed, actionable descriptions.
        - Leverage the llms context awareness for consistent terminology.
    </writing_style>
    
    <quality_checks>

## **Course Duration Calculation**

This course is designed to be delivered over 5 days, with each day consisting of 6 hours of content delivery and 2 hours allocated for breaks.

**Time Constants:**

*   `HOURS_PER_DAY = 8`
*   `CONTENT_HOURS_PER_DAY = 6`
*   `BREAK_DURATION_MINUTES = 15`
*   `DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5`
*   `BREAKS_PER_HOUR = 1`

**Calculation:**

1. **Total Content Hours:**
    *   The course is designed for 5 days.
    *   Each day has 6 content hours.
    *   Total content hours = 5 days \* 6 hours/day = 30 hours

2. **Break Calculation:**
    *   Each content hour includes one 15-minute break.
    *   Total break time per day = 6 content hours \* 15 minutes/hour = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours
    *   Total break time for the course = 1.5 hours/day \* 5 days = 7.5 hours

3. **Total Course Duration:**
    *   Total course duration = Total content hours + Total break time
    *   Total course duration = 30 hours + 7.5 hours = 37.5 hours

**Therefore, the total duration of the course is 37.5 hours, delivered over 5 days.**
